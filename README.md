This is the accompanying code for the paper below.

Xian Wang, "Deeper and Wider Convolutional Recurrent Model for Vocal Melody Extraction," 2023, unpublished.

tensorflow version: 2.12
GPU ram: 12 GB

For your convenience, I have uploaded the checkpoint of the trained model, which is in the folder ckpts.
This script has been properly configured to run the model in inference mode using the above checkpoint, so you do not need
to train the model yourself from scratch.

If you would like to train the model yourself, please follow the training process given in the paper, step by step in an
incremental manner.
